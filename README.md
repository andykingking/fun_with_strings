# Fun with strings

## Purpose

Random string manipulation methods. Possible uses:

* Fuzzy string matching
* Showing your friends how not to code
* Print it out and use it to level a table

## Future

May implement some more fun algorithms. May also rewrite in C for speedy goodness. May not do either.
